# MachineLearning-StudentActivity

##### This is a Machine Learning Project. Our Teach. Giuseppe Polese and the engineer Stefano Riemma give to us a DataSet regardless student's degree of department of Engineering of University of Salerno. We have to try to develop a ML Classifier to discover if the high-school background can influence the student's results at the University.

### Stay tuned!! We are in Development!!
